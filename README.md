# Givvit - Crowdfunding, connections, and growth
Givvit is a social networking website developed for the Web Technology course at unibo, based on the exchange of projects. You can share your ideas with your friends or discover new ones in the Explore page, and anyone can donate to support other ideas and see them come to life.

## How to use
* Clone the repo into your web server.
* Use the "create" and "populate" scripts in the src/db folder to get the database and some sample data.
* Use the "index.php" file as the entry point for the website.
* You can use the test profile (username: example, password: example) if you do not want to create a new one.
